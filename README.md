## Description

Research suggests that slide presentations are ineffective in education. Yet virtually all teachers spend hours refining them, and students have come to expect them.

This **slide machine** returns power (and time) to the educator. Now you can lecture or talk about whatever you want, and the slides will follow. Just make sure your microphone is on and enabled in the web browser.

## Requirements

- OpenAI: requires an **OpenAI API Key**. You can get create an account and make one at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
- Browser: curerently **Google Chrome** only, since Google only allows their own browser to use their speech recognition API for free.
