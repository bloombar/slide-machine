# Stale branch & PR check

Run this **before starting a slice** and **before reviewing one**. On a long multi-phase build the most
expensive failure is two slices editing the same files from different bases, and that is invisible unless
somebody looks.

```bash
# 1. What is already in flight? An open PR touching your files means coordinate, not proceed.
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,updatedAt,files \
  --jq '.[] | "#\(.number) \(.headRefName) — \(.title) (updated \(.updatedAt))"'

# 2. Is this branch behind its base? A slice built on a stale base merges dirty.
#    The default branch here is `better-faster`, not master or main.
git fetch origin --quiet
git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/better-faster   # commits on the base we do not have

# 3. Which remote branches are merged and can be deleted?
git branch -r --merged origin/better-faster \
  | grep -v 'origin/better-faster\|origin/HEAD' || echo "none"

# 4. Which remote branches have gone quiet? Anything older than ~2 weeks with no PR is a candidate.
git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/remotes/origin \
  --format='%(refname:short)  %(committerdate:relative)'
```

## How to act on it

| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| An open PR touches files in your slice          | **Stop and report it.** Do not edit those files in parallel; the supervisor decides whether to rebase, wait, or re-scope.        |
| Your branch is behind its base                  | Rebase onto the base before starting. Starting from a stale base is how a clean review turns into a merge conflict nobody reads. |
| A merged branch still exists on the remote      | Report it for deletion. Do not delete branches yourself — the supervisor owns the git history.                                   |
| A branch is quiet, unmerged, and has no open PR | Report it. It is either abandoned work to drop or unfinished work to finish, and both need a human-level decision.               |
